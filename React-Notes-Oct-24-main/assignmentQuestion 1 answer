give a task which includes Map(),filter,find,reduce in Javascript as combined assignment with solution
Sure! Hereâ€™s a combined task that uses map(), filter(), find(), and reduce() in JavaScript. The task will involve processing an array of user orders and generating a summary report.

Task: Process and Summarize Orders
Given an array of user orders, your task is to:

Filter out orders that are not delivered.

Map the remaining orders to extract necessary details.

Find the order placed by a specific user.

Use reduce() to calculate the total revenue from all delivered orders.

Data Structure:
Hereâ€™s an example array of orders:

javascript
const orders = [
  { id: 1, userId: 101, product: 'Laptop', amount: 999, delivered: true },
  { id: 2, userId: 102, product: 'Phone', amount: 699, delivered: false },
  { id: 3, userId: 101, product: 'Tablet', amount: 499, delivered: true },
  { id: 4, userId: 103, product: 'Monitor', amount: 199, delivered: true },
  { id: 5, userId: 104, product: 'Keyboard', amount: 49, delivered: false },
  { id: 6, userId: 102, product: 'Mouse', amount: 25, delivered: true },
];
Steps:
Filter out orders that are not delivered.

Map the remaining orders to extract userId and amount.

Find the first order placed by user 102.

Reduce the array to calculate the total revenue from all delivered orders.

Solution:
javascript
const orders = [
  { id: 1, userId: 101, product: 'Laptop', amount: 999, delivered: true },
  { id: 2, userId: 102, product: 'Phone', amount: 699, delivered: false },
  { id: 3, userId: 101, product: 'Tablet', amount: 499, delivered: true },
  { id: 4, userId: 103, product: 'Monitor', amount: 199, delivered: true },
  { id: 5, userId: 104, product: 'Keyboard', amount: 49, delivered: false },
  { id: 6, userId: 102, product: 'Mouse', amount: 25, delivered: true },
];

// 1. Filter out orders that are not delivered
const deliveredOrders = orders.filter(order => order.delivered);

console.log('Delivered Orders:', deliveredOrders);

// 2. Map the remaining orders to extract userId and amount
const orderSummaries = deliveredOrders.map(order => ({
  userId: order.userId,
  amount: order.amount
}));

console.log('Order Summaries:', orderSummaries);

// 3. Find the first order placed by user 102
const user102Order = orders.find(order => order.userId === 102);

console.log('First Order by User 102:', user102Order);

// 4. Reduce the array to calculate the total revenue from all delivered orders
const totalRevenue = deliveredOrders.reduce((accumulator, order) => {
  return accumulator + order.amount;
}, 0);

console.log('Total Revenue:', totalRevenue);
Explanation:
Filter:

const deliveredOrders = orders.filter(order => order.delivered);

Filters the orders array to include only orders that are delivered.

Map:

const orderSummaries = deliveredOrders.map(order => ({ userId: order.userId, amount: order.amount }));

Maps the filtered orders to extract the userId and amount properties.

Find:

const user102Order = orders.find(order => order.userId === 102);

Finds the first order in the orders array placed by user with userId 102.

Reduce:

const totalRevenue = deliveredOrders.reduce((accumulator, order) => accumulator + order.amount, 0);

Reduces the filtered array to calculate the total revenue from all delivered orders.

This task combines map(), filter(), find(), and reduce() to demonstrate how these powerful array methods can work together to process and summarize data effectively. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š

Assignment: Processing and Summarizing Orders using JavaScript Array Methods
Objective:
You are provided with an array of user orders. Your task is to process these orders and generate a summary report using JavaScript array methods. Specifically, you need to use map(), filter(), find(), and reduce() methods to perform the following steps:

Given Data:
const orders = [
  { id: 1, userId: 101, product: 'Laptop', amount: 999, delivered: true },
  { id: 2, userId: 102, product: 'Phone', amount: 699, delivered: false },
  { id: 3, userId: 101, product: 'Tablet', amount: 499, delivered: true },
  { id: 4, userId: 103, product: 'Monitor', amount: 199, delivered: true },
  { id: 5, userId: 104, product: 'Keyboard', amount: 49, delivered: false },
  { id: 6, userId: 102, product: 'Mouse', amount: 25, delivered: true },
];
